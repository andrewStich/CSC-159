<h3>Goals</h3>

<ol>
<li>
In the previous OS phase a new process can run within a confined real
memory space. In this phase a virtual space is given to processes,
ranging from 256MB (0x10000000) to just under 1GB (1G-1B, 0x3fffffff).
<p>
<li>
Virtual space is of cousre supported fragmently by several RAM pages
(for those most recently used instruction and data locations). The
hardware device that does the address translation is the <i>Memory
Management Unit</i> (MMU). Each address the CPU uses to fetch instruction
or read/write data is a virtual address, to be translated by the MMU
<i>on the fly</i> and relayed to the memory cache system to obtain.
<p>
<li>
Each process created by calling <i>ExecCall()</i> will now run in a
virtual space. The instruction of the process will start from 256MB
and end at 1G-1B.
<p>
<li>
In ExecSR() a translation table for MMU to use when the process runs
will be created. When a process is to be loaded by Loader(), the MMU
will be given the table address by <i>set_cr3(pcb[run_pid].main_table)</i>.
And when a process ends, the MMU will return to use the original
<i>kernel_main_table</i>.
<p>
<li>
The kernel_main_table is already created by the SPEDE code. The first
4 entries from it will be copied to create a new table for a new
process, in order for it to map into the kernel space for service
(when the kernel code runs).
</ol>

<h3>Virtual Address Translation</h3>
<ol>
<li>
The Intel MMU has a <i>two-tier</i> translation scheme: the first 10
bits in a 32-bit virtual address form an entry number to index into
a main table, and the real RAM address of a <i>subtable</i> can be
obtained from the entry. The next 10 bits in the virtual address
following form an entry number to index into the subtable that has
the real address of a RAM page containing instructions or data. The
last 12 bits in the virtual address are the byte number in the page.
<p>
<li>
Each PCB will have an <b><i>int main_table</b></i> to hold the address
of the main translation table created for the process. Call
<i>set_cr3(pcb[run_pid].main_table)</i></b> to set MMU before Loader(),
in order to start the address translation.
<p>
<li>
A valid entry in a translation table is set with a real address of 
of a 4KB RAM page. Most entries are not set initially. The MMU will
issue a <i>not-present</i> page-fault exception to the CPU if any
such entry is selected for address translation. There are flags in
each table entry such as <i>present</i> to indicate the page status.
More on flags below.
<p>
<li>
The ExecSR() will first allocate five RAM pages for the creation of
a main table, a code subtable, a stack subtable, a code page, and a
stack page. Each main table or subtable has 1024 entries. Each entry
is 4 bytes in size. Each table is 4KB (to fit into a RAM page).
<p>
<li>
One entry in the main table points to the code subtable, and another
to the stack subtable. Since the virtual space starts at 256MB
(0x10000000), the first 10 bits of this number is 64, read by the
MMU, as the entry of the main table to get the RAM address of a code
subtable. The next 10 bits is 0, as the entry number in the code
subtable to get a code page. The last 12 bits of 256M is the byte
offset in the code page, and the place a CPU instruction is obtained.
<p>
<li>
The argument and trapframe of the process will be located towards
the end of the virtual space 1G-1B (0x3fffffff). The 1st 10 bits 
of this number is 255, the entry number in the main table for a
RAM address of a stack subtable. The 2nd 10 bits of this virtual
address is 1023, the entry number in the stack subtable for a real
RAM address of a stack page. The last 12 bits are the byte address
in the stack pag to read/write data.
<p>
<li>
When reclaiming RAM pages of an exiting process, the MMU should be
switched back to the kernel_main_table. Otherwise, the system will
have to reboot since the translation tables may no longer be there.
(Especially if we choose to clear the memory for security.)
<p>
<li>
When creating the trapframe for a virtual space process, the eip
should be set to 256MB, and the process trapframe address should be
set to <i>V_TF</i>, a constant: 2G - the space for a trapframe and
2 integers.
</ol>

<h3>Address Translation Mechanism</h3>

<ol>
<li>
The Intel MMU uses a 2-tier translation scheme (main table - subtables)
in order to save RAM space. A 32-bit virtual address is read into 3 parts.
The first 10 bits is the entry number of a main table, the second 10 bits
is the entry number of a subtable (code or stack), and the last 12 bits
is the byte offset in a code or stack page.
   <ol type=a>
   <li>Main Table: initialized with 6 entries (to 6 subtables).
       The first 4 entries are duplicated from kernel_main_table.
       The other 2 entries have addresses to a code and stack subtables.
   <li>Code Subtable: the 1st entry has the address to a code page.
   <li>Stack Subtable: the last entry holds the address of a stack page.
   <li>Code Page: has process instructions.
   <li>Stack Page: has a process trapframe (with eip set to 256M), and argument.
   <li>Trapfrme pointer in PCB: 1G minus the space of a trapframe and two integers.
   </ol>
<p>
<li>
Before a process is loaded to run in main() and Kernel(), use
<i>set_cr3()</i> to set the translation table for MMU.
<p>
<li>
Since each RAM page starts at some interval of 4KB, only the first 20 bits
in these addresses change, and the trailing 12 bits are always zeros.
Hence, in a table entry these 12 bits are used as attribute flags for the
RAM page. The important flags are, from the rightmost bit:
<ol type=a>
<li><tt>PRESENT</tt>: 0 page not present, 1 page present.
<li><tt>RO / RW</tt>: 0 read-only page, 1 read-writable page
<li><tt>USER MODE</tt>: 0 superuser to access, 1 user can access
<li><tt>CACHE POLICY</tt>: 0 write back; 1 write-through (if cache-use set)
<li><tt>CACHE USE</tt>: 0 page content not to be cached, 1 to be cached
<li><tt>ACCESSED</tt>: 0 entry never looked up by MMU, 1 accessed by MMU
<li><tt>DIRTY</tt>: 0 page content not changed/written, 1 changed/written
</ol>
<p>
<li>
We will only need to set the RW and Present flags to 1. This is done in
ExecSR() as each entry is being initialized with a 4KB RAM address bitwise
OR-ed with two flags.
<p>
<li>
The target PC reboots once a conflict occurs against any of the flags
during runtime: "Page not present, write to a Read Only page, process
in the user mode tries to access a kernel-mode page, etc. Hence, you
must use GDB to verify entries in tables at the end of ExecSR().
<p>
<li>
ExitSR and WaitSR will need to deal with virtual space complications.
ExitSR will need to set the translation table use back to the original
kernel_main_table as a process ends (its tables are reclaimed).
In order to get into the child's virtual space to get the exit code
in WaitSR(), the MMU will need to use the child's translation table
briefly to access its trapframe.
</ol>

<h3>Demo Run</h3>
<ol>
<li>
The demo runs exactly like the previous phase, but the code is a lot more
sophisticated. The virtual memory requires the management of RAM pages and
correct switching of translation tables.
<p>
<li>
Test by adding "SleepCall(1500);" after the KillCall() line of UserProc.
This will have children finish racing before the parent does any WaitCall().
This will test if the virtual space switching between processes in WaitSR()
is correctly done.
</ol>

<h3>Deliverables</h3>
<ol>
Source files as usual, other restrictions and requirements of not conducting
plagiarism as usual (see the deiverable description in previous phases).
</ol>

<h3>Review Questions</h3>

How to write code to trigger page faults so it will need new pages
allocated during runtime? How should your OS handle this? Wouldn't
the recovery of a page fault requires rolling back the instruction
pointer to retry the intruction?

How can our OS maintain a healthy proportion of RAM space not used?
How can LRU counts be implemented? How to indicate a page was swapped
out in the swap space (not brand new)?
<p>
<li>
Can translation tables also be subject to swapped in and out with a
"swap disk partition" like normal process pages?
<p>
<li>
The MMU has TLB to cache table entries. The instruction and data are
