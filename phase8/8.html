<big><b>Phase 8 &nbsp; <i>Signal</i> IPC II: <i>Alpha Derby!</i></b></big></b>
</center>

<h3>The Goal</h3>
In this phase, we can have a little fun of a video game called
<i>Alpha Derby!</i>. Once <i>race</i> is entered from a terminal,
the parent process (UserProc) will, in a loop, "fork" 5 child
processes and each child will ExecCall with Aout like before.
<p>
The Aout code will issue a <b><i>void PauseCall(void)</b></i>
to stop the process before it loops to show a character across
the screen as the previous phase.
<p>
While all children have paused, the parent (UserProc), after
the "fork" loop, will sleep for 3 seconds (to make sure all
children have time to reach the pausing point. The parent
continues to issue a <i>void KillCall(0, SIGGO)</i> which
sends a signal to all paused children to start the race loop
(to be released by the KillSR actually).
<p>
In the Aout race loop, the sleep time will be changed from
the fixed 10 centi-seconds in the previous phase to a random
period. This can be obtained by yet another new <i>unsigned
RandCall(void)</i> which returns a (pseudo) random number
ranging from 0 to 2G-1 (2147483647).
The code applies this random number with modulus of 20, and
plus 5, to make a random centi-seconds between 5 and 24 for
sleeping time.
<p>
The parent (UserProc), after the KillCall, will loop again
5 times to issue WaitCall() and show the child exiting (winning)
sequence: convert the exit code to the proper alphabet of the
child process (according to how the demo runs.)
<p>

<h3>Pause Service</h3>
<li>
A new <i>void PauseCall(void)</i> will link to <i>PauseSR</i>
which will alter the state of the running process to a new
state <i>PAUSE</i>, and have the <i>run_pid</i> reset.
<p>
<li>
In a real OS, this is practiced as putting the process to sleep
indefinitely until an event that wakes it up but we will do it
in this simplified way without involving the sleep queue.
<p>

<h3>Kill Service</h3>
<li>
The kill service is actually to send a signal to other processes.
The syscall <i>void KillCall(pid, signum)</i> when used with 0
for the pid, then the signal signum is sent to all child processes.
A <i>paused</i> process will resume upon any signum. Hence, here
we will just use a generic name for the signal: <i>SIGGO</i>.
<p>
<li>
The <i>KillSR</i> in the case of delivering a signal to all child
processes, the PCB array is searched through for processes that has
the parent PID equal to the calling process PID and is in the PAUSE
state, to be released into the ready queue and have the state upgraded,
in order to get to run again.
<p>

<h3>Rand Service</h3>
<li>
The <i>unsigned RandCall(void)</i> will return a random number ranging
from 0 to 2G-1 (2147483647). The simpliest pseudo number X can be
obtained by X = (aX + b) % m where a, b, and m are large numbers.
<p>
<li>
The X is recursively used to generate the next X. Hence, the initial
X is called the seed of the random number. In order to have various
seeds, we can use the system time (sys_centi_sec) when the 1st 'n'
key is pressed to seed the X. Further we can use the running PID
as the multiplier of X (aX). For b, we can choose a prime number
number such as 6700417.
<p>
<li>
The random is calculated by <i>unsigned RandSR</i> and returned via trapframe.

<h3>Deliverables</h3>
<blockquote>
As before, submit only source-code files (*.c, *.h, and k-entry.S) to your
team dropbox on host Voyager, in the designated phase folder.

<h3>Review Questions</h3>
<li>
Where are the places in an OS design that matter the fairness of game plays?
<p>
<li>
In particular, what places are difficult to be fair? Or, can they ever be
fair at all?
